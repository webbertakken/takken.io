Agile methodology is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps
teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting
everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments.

Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for
responding to change quickly.
