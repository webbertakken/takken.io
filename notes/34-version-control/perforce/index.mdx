# Perforce

Perforce is a version control system that's well suited for large projects.

Since Git is [not so well suited](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17723552/3593896) for repositories
over 1 gigabyte, it's better to use Perforce for Unreal Engine projects.

Perforce has a server and a client component. The server is called _Helix Core_ and the client is
called _P4V_.

Within Perforce we will be using the newer Stream-Depot model, which has the newer features and is
more suited for Unreal Engine projects.

## Vocabulary

### Concepts

- Depot (remote): A repository of files.
- Stream: A branch of the depot.
- Workspace (local): A local copy of the depot (mapped to a stream).
- Client: Synonym for workspace.
- TypeMap: A file that maps file types to Perforce commands. (similar to `.gitattributes` in Git)
- Ignore file: A file, commonly `.p4ignore`, that lists files that should be ignored by Perforce.

### Workflow

- Check out: To lock a file for editing.
- Changelist: A set of changes to files.
- Submit: To send a changelist to the depot.
