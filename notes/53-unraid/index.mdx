# Unraid

## Introduction

:::info

Unraid is a Linux distribution that incorporates the ability to run virtual machines and docker
containers while also providing a NAS environment. It is a paid product, but it is well worth the
money.

:::

I'm running Unraid for my persistent workloads, such as my [Home Assistant](../home-assistant)
setup, Pi-hole, Discord bots and other custom automations etc.

Because this server running 24/7, I've opted for a custom-built energy efficient server.

## Subsections

- [My server](./efficient-server)
- [Commands](./commands)

## Docker

### Using private registries

For personal applications, I use a private registry to store my docker images.

To use a private registry in Unraid, you need to authenticate with the registry. This can be done by
running the `docker login` command on the Unraid server.

```bash
docker login registry.example.com
```

this.
