# Unraid

## Introduction

:::info

Unraid is a Linux distribution that incorporates the ability to run virtual machines and docker
containers while also providing a NAS environment. It is a paid product, but it is well worth the
money.

:::

I'm running Unraid for my persistent workloads, such as my [Home Assistant](../home-assistant)
setup, Pi-hole, Discord bots and other custom automations etc.

Because this server running 24/7, I've opted for a custom-built energy efficient server.
