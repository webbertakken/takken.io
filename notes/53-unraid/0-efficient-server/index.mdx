# Efficient server

I've built a server that's both powerful and quite energy efficient. It has modern hardware running
on less than 10 Watts!

In this chapter I've documented my reasoning around the build and each component. I also explain the
tweaks I've done for my specific setup.

## Hardware

Let's start with the hardware. What did I get and why?

In order to tell you why, I need to tell you what requirements I had.

### Requirements

- Since it will be running Home Assistant, and basically be the brain of my home, it needs to be
  **reliable**.
- It also needs to run 24/7 without costing a fortune in electricity, so **low power usage**.
- I really wanted it to be able to run a few virtualised workloads for when I want to play around
  with stuff, so **decent performance**.
- My 19" rack is connected to the kitchen, so it needs to be **quiet**.

### Research

I did a lot of research on what hardware to get and looked at many different options.

:::info

One of the main resources I used was
[The Big Efficient Server Topic (Part 3)](https://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/2096876/0)
on a Dutch tech website called [Tweakers.net](https://tweakers.net). It really is a great resource
for anyone looking to build an energy efficient server.

### Components

These are the components I ended up with. I've tried to describe my reasoning for each component,
but if you have any questions please don't hesitate to drop a comment.

## Efficiency tweaks

### Measuring

To measure the power usage I used a calibrated
[Nous A1T](/notes/home-assistant/devices/nous-a1t-16a-power-monitoring-plug/).

I calibrated the plug using a multi meter and a 40W light bulb (resistive load).

<ImageWrapper>
  <Image img={require('./assets/amps-reading.jpg')} alt="Amps reading" />
  <Image img={require('./assets/voltage-reading.jpg')} alt="Voltage reading" />
</ImageWrapper>

### First boot

First thing I did was boot it up with no additional settings. Not surprisingly, it crashed while
booting into Unraid. Loading an OS is CPU heavy task and the energy usage spiked above the maximum
the PSU could handle.

So the first tweak was to

- set the CPU TDP limit to 35W.

After this everything worked very smoothly. 🎉

Time for stats!

### Stress testing

I ran a stress test with `mprime` to see what the maximum power usage was.

Source: https://www.mersenne.org/download/

```shell
# Download
wget https://www.mersenne.org/download/software/v30/30.8/p95v308b17.linux64.tar.gz

# Extract
mkdir mprime && tar -xf ./p95v308b17.linux64.tar.gz -C mprime

# Manual
./mprime/mprime --help

# Run
./mprime/mprime -t
```

For the visual people among us, here's what that looks like:

<Image img={require('./assets/run-mprime.png')} alt="Run mprime" />
<ImageWrapper>
  <Image img={require('./assets/unraid-load.png')} alt="Unraid reading of the loads" />
  <Image img={require('./assets/energy-reading.png')} alt="Energy reading in Nous A1T" />
</ImageWrapper>

### Initial stats

Now that we know both our idle and stress power usage, we can start tweaking.

But before that, time for the initial stats!

| Idle low | Idle avg | Idle high |     | Stress low | Stress avg | Stress high |
| :------: | :------: | :-------: | --- | :--------: | :--------: | :---------: |
|   11W    | **13W**  |    16W    |     |    54W     |  **56W**   |     62W     |

What's interesting is that even without any tweaks, the idle power usage of the server is already
very low.

This has everything to do with the specific hardware that was chosen, especially the motherboard
with its focus on energy efficiency and the power supply unit (PSU) not being so large that it
becomes inefficient at low loads.

:::info

The server will be running 24/7, so the average idle power usage is the most important metric here.

:::

:::note

The artificial load of the stress test is not representative of real world usage. Therefore, I will
not be using the `high` values but at maximum the `avg` values when reconfiguring max TDP for the
CPU.

:::

## BIOS tweaks

### BIOS tweaks: Turn off unused devices

Firstly, the most obvious tweaks: turning off all the things we don't need.

- Audio: Disabled
- PCI Express Slot 1: Disabled
- PCI Express Slot 2: Disabled
- PCI Express Slot 3: Disabled
- PCI Express Slot 4: Disabled
- Serial port: Disabled

Great results so far!

| Idle low | Idle avg | Idle high |
| :------: | :------: | :-------: |
|    8W    | **10W**  |    13W    |

### BIOS tweaks: Review all relevant settings

#### CPU

- Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology: Enabled (was Enabled)
- Turbo Boost: Disabled (was Enabled)
- C States: Enabled (was Enabled)
- Package C State Limit: Auto (was Auto)

And since there's some headroom left, I also increase the maximum power limit.

- CPU TDP Limit: 60W (was 35W)

#### USB

- USB 3.1 Gen 2 speed: Disabled (was Enabled)
- USB Port Control: Enable rear and internal ports (was Enable all ports)

#### NIC

- Wake on LAN: Disabled (was Enabled)

#### PCI

- Above 4G Decoding: Disabled (was Enabled)

| Idle low | Idle avg | Idle high |
| :------: | :------: | :-------: |
|    7W    | **9.5W** |    12W    |

### BIOS tweaks: Disable graphics

The default settings for my motherboard are as follows:

- Primary display: Auto
- Internal graphics: Auto

:::info

When using `Internal graphics: Auto`, the BIOS detects automatically if the internal graphics
controller can be disabled.

:::

This means that the next test is to pull out the monitor cable and see how it affects power usage.
Unfortunately pulling out the cable didn't make any difference.

I then manually disabled the internal graphics controller, which did seem to make a small
difference, but still too small to measure.

:::info

At this point the difference also becomes hard to measure, as the power usage can jump around a bit
and the update interval of the Nous A1T is about 1 second.

:::

I wasn't able to detect a significant difference in power usage with this tweak.

## Software tweaks

Software tweaks can help out where hardware settings are not sufficient or not available. One of the
main things to focus on is the CPU, or more specifically, the C-states.

### C-states

:::info

C-states, also known as CPU states, are power-saving states for processors (CPUs) in modern computer
systems. These states are designed to reduce the power consumption of the CPU when it is idle or not
performing any computational tasks.

:::

The different C-states (C0 through C10) represent varying levels of power-saving modes:

- C0 is the operating state.
- C10 is the deepest idle state.
- The higher the C-state, the more power is saved.

We'll use Powertop to try and improve the C-state usage.

### Powertop

:::info

Powertop is a tool provided by Intel to enable various power saving modes in userspace, kernel and
on hardware level.

:::

Powertop comes as one of the recommended tools to tweak power usage on Linux. It's a tool that gives
you quite a bit of insight into what's going on with your system. It also allows you to tweak some
settings.

I've followed
[this guide](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/98070-reduce-power-consumption-with-powertop/) to
install it on Unraid. I'll describe some of the steps here.

#### Install

Download the file in /boot/extra, then reboot to automatically install it.

```shell
mkdir /boot/extra
cd /boot/extra
wget https://github.com/mgutt/unraid-packages/raw/main/6.11.0/powertop-2.15-x86_64-1.txz
```

#### Analyse

Run powertop without `--auto-tune` (for now) to get an overview of what's going on.

```shell
powertop
```

On the `Idle stats` tab it looks like much of the time is spent in the C2 state.

<Image img={require('./assets/powertop-idle-states.png')} alt="Powertop idle stats" />

Looking at the `Tunables` tab: It seems like there are many things to tune still.

<Image img={require('./assets/powertop-tunables.png')} alt="Powertop tunables" />

#### Tuning

Now that we have an overview of what's going on, let's try to tune some of the settings.

```shell
powertop --auto-tune

# or alternatively
powertop --quiet --auto-tune
```

:::note

This command will be undone after every reboot, unless you add it to the `go` file. Keep reading 🙂

:::

After running this command, the `Tunables` tab looks like this:

<Image img={require('./assets/powertop-tunables-tuned.png')} alt="Powertop tunables tuned" />

The `Idle stats` tab looks a lot better now too: Instead of the CPU spending most of the time in the
C2 state it's now spending most of the time in the C8 state.

<Image img={require('./assets/powertop-idle-states-tuned.png')} alt="Powertop idle stats tuned" />

#### Keep tuning after reboot

First of, let's test that the array still comes up after tuning.

In Unraid stop the array, then run the tuning command again.

```shell
powertop --quiet --auto-tune
```

Now start the array again. If the array comes up, you should be good to go.

To keep the tuning after reboot, add the tuning command to the `go` file like so:

```shell
echo "powertop --quiet --auto-tune" >> /boot/config/go
```

Finally, reboot and check if everything still works as expected.

```shell
reboot
```

### Results

Et voilà! After applying tuning, the power usage is down to 7W on average. Awesome! 🎉

| Idle low | Idle avg | Idle high |
| :------: | :------: | :-------: |
|    6W    |  **7W**  |    10W    |

## Conclusion

And there we have it!

A powerful server that uses only 7W on average when idle. I'm really happy with the results.
