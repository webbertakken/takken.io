# Efficient server

I've built a server that's both powerful and quite energy efficient. It has modern hardware running
on less than 15 Watts!

In this chapter I've documented my reasoning around the build and each component. I also explain the
tweaks I've done for my specific setup.

## Hardware

Let's start with the hardware. What did I get and why?

In order to tell you why, I need to tell you what requirements I had.

### Requirements

- Since it will be running Home Assistant, and basically be the brain of my home, it needs to be
  **reliable**.
- It also needs to run 24/7 without costing a fortune in electricity, so **low power usage**.
- I really wanted it to be able to run a few virtualised workloads for when I want to play around
  with stuff, so **decent performance**.
- My 19" rack is connected to the kitchen, so it needs to be **quiet**.

### Research

I did a lot of research on what hardware to get and looked at many different options.

:::info

One of the main resources I used was
[The Big Efficient Server Topic (Part 3)](https://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/2096876/0)
on a Dutch tech website called [Tweakers.net](https://tweakers.net). It really is a great resource
for anyone looking to build an energy efficient server.

### Components

These are the components I ended up with. I've tried to describe my reasoning for each component,
but if you have any questions please don't hesitate to drop a comment.

### The build

Here's what the build looks like.

## Efficiency tweaks

### Measuring

To measure the power usage I used a calibrated
[Nous A1T](/notes/home-assistant/devices/nous-a1t-16a-power-monitoring-plug/).

I calibrated the plug using a multi meter and a 40W light bulb (resistive load).

  <Image img={require('./assets/amps-reading.jpg')} alt="Amps reading" />
  <Image img={require('./assets/voltage-reading.jpg')} alt="Voltage reading" />
</ImageWrapper>

### First boot

First thing I did was boot it up with no additional settings. Not surprisingly, it crashed while
booting into Unraid. Loading an OS is CPU heavy task and the energy usage spiked above the maximum
the PSU could handle.

So the first tweak was to

- set the CPU TDP limit to 35W.

After this everything worked very smoothly. ðŸŽ‰

Time for stats!

### Stress testing

I ran a stress test with `mprime` to see what the maximum power usage was.

Source: https://www.mersenne.org/download/

```shell
# Download
wget https://www.mersenne.org/download/software/v30/30.8/p95v308b17.linux64.tar.gz

# Extract
mkdir mprime && tar -xf ./p95v308b17.linux64.tar.gz -C mprime

# Manual
./mprime/mprime --help

# Run
./mprime/mprime -t
```

For the visual people among us, here's what that looks like:

<Image img={require('./assets/install-mprime.png')} alt="Install mprime" />
<Image img={require('./assets/run-mprime.png')} alt="Run mprime" />

  <Image img={require('./assets/unraid-load.png')} alt="Unraid reading of the loads" />
  <Image img={require('./assets/energy-reading.png')} alt="Energy reading in Nous A1T" />
</ImageWrapper>

### Initial stats

Now that we know both our idle and stress power usage, we can start tweaking.

But before that, time for the initial stats!

| Idle low | Idle avg | Idle high |     | Stress low | Stress avg | Stress high |
| :------: | :------: | :-------: | --- | :--------: | :--------: | :---------: |
|   11W    | **13W**  |    16W    |     |    54W     |  **56W**   |     62W     |

:::info

The server will be running 24/7, so the average idle power usage is the most important metric.

:::

:::note

The artificial load is not representative of real world usage. Therefore, I will not be using the
`high` values but at maximum the `avg` values when reconfiguring max TDP for the CPU.
