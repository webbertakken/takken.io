#### Installation

This smart plug comes with Tasmota firmware pre-installed.

It needs to be connected to Wi-Fi and then configured to connect to the MQTT broker. Finally the
device needs to be calibrated so that the energy readings are correct.

##### Connect to Wi-Fi

1. Plug it in (light will be blinking)
2. Connect to the Wi-Fi network `tasmota-xxxx`
3. Open http://192.168.4.1
4. Connect it to your Wi-Fi network

If you did it correctly it will redirect your browser to the IP address it got from your DHCP
server.

##### Configure MQTT

1. Open the web interface of the smart plug
2. Go to `Configuration` > `Configure MQTT`
3. Enter the IP address or DNS name of your MQTT broker
4. Enter the username and password of your MQTT broker
5. Click `Save`

If you did it correctly you should be able to see the smart plug in the MQTT broker.

##### Calibrate power monitoring

You need another device that can measure the power consumption of the smart plug.

1. Plug the smart plug into the power meter
2. Plug a device into the smart plug that has a constant energy usage and uses 30W or more
3. Open the web interface of the smart plug
4. Go to `Console`
5. Read Wattage from the power meter then type `PowerSet 60.0` and press `Enter`
6. Read Voltage from the power meter then type `VoltageSet 235.5` and press `Enter`
7. Read Current from the power meter then type `CurrentSet 254.777` and press `Enter`

:::tip Calculating current

1000\*(60.0/235.5) = 254.777

:::

8. Restart the smart plug by typing `Restart 1` and press `Enter`
