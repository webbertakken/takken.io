#### Installation

This smart plug comes with Tasmota firmware pre-installed.

It needs to be connected to Wi-Fi and then configured to connect to the MQTT broker. Finally the
device needs to be calibrated so that the energy readings are correct.

##### Connect to Wi-Fi

1. Plug it in (light will be blinking)
2. Connect to the Wi-Fi network `tasmota-xxxx`
3. Open http://192.168.4.1
4. Connect it to your Wi-Fi network

If you did it correctly it will redirect your browser to the IP address it got from your DHCP
server.

##### Configure MQTT

1. Open the web interface of the smart plug
2. Go to `Configuration` > `Configure MQTT`
3. Enter the IP address or DNS name of your MQTT broker
4. Enter the username and password of your MQTT broker
5. Click `Save`

If you did it correctly you should be able to see the smart plug in the MQTT broker.

##### Calibrate power monitoring

You need another power meter or multi meter that can measure the power consumption of the smart
plug.

1. Plug the smart plug into the power meter (or multi meter)
2. Plug a device into the smart plug that has a constant energy usage and uses between 30W and 50W.

:::tip

Resistive loads, like oldskool incandescent light bulbs ðŸ’¡, have a power factor of 1.

:::

3. Open the web interface of the smart plug
4. Go to `Console`
5. Read the values and enter them in [this tool](/tools/tasmotahelper).
6. Enter the resulting commands in the console of the smart plug one by one.
7. Restart the smart plug by using the command `Restart 1`.

If you did it correctly you should see the power consumption of the smart plug in the web interface.

And in case you used a resistive load, like an incandescent light bulb, the Active Power reading
should be the same as the Apparent Power reading. In this example they are set to 42W and 42VA
respectively.

:::note

Power consumption graph changes after calibration.
