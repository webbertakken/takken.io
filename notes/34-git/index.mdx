# Git

Here are my notes on Git.

## Introduction

Using Git is an essential skill for almost every developer. Git sounds simple enough, but it does
have a bit of a learning curve. And if you get stuck, it can be hard to get unstuck if you lack some
understanding.

Over the years I've derived at a relatively simple and foolproof workflow. I'll first describe the
basic steps. Then I'll describe how to deal with specific situations, like merge conflicts.

:::note

I'm using [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and opt-in ot the linux tools for bash
during the installation, which allows using linux commands in Windows (PowerShell 7+)

## One-time setup

### Setup key

(once per machine)

I use SSH keys to authenticate with GitHub. The private key requires a passphrase, so I'm the only
one who can use it.

To set up a new key I always use
[this excellent guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
from GitHub.

### Setup git config

(once per machine)

Over the years I've collected a few useful settings for my git config. Take what you need.

```ini
# ~/.gitconfig

# First things first, always set up your user info.
[user]
name = my_username
email = my_email@example.com

# Display colours in the console
[color]
ui = auto
branch = auto
status = auto

# Always rebase when using `git pull`, except for `main, master, develop` branches.
[branch]
autosetuprebase = always

[branch "main"]
rebase = false

[branch "master"]
rebase = false

[branch "develop"]
rebase = false

# Automatically set up remote tracking branches for all new local branches.
[push]
autoSetupRemote = true

# Important setting in windows that allows working on both Windows and cross-platform projects
[core]
eol = native
autocrlf = input

# Common typos and aliases for long commands
[alias]
chekcout = checkout
ocmmit = commit
statsu = status
sttaus = status
fa = fetch --all
pushf = push --force-with-lease
stsah = stash

# Common LFS Settings
[filter "lfs"]
smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
process = git-lfs filter-process
required = true
clean = git-lfs clean -- %f

# How private registries are handled
[credential "https://my_company_vcs.example.com"]
provider = generic
```

### Clone

(once per repository)

I usually clone using SSH, because my private key has a passphrase for extra security.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:webbertakken/takken.io.git
```

:::note

LFS repositories really don't work well with SSH, so in those cases I clone using HTTPS instead.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/webbertakken/takken.io.git
```

### The Commit tool window

(discovering this feature: once in your life)

To review the changes I use WebStorms built-in `commit` tool window.

<Image img={require('./assets/commit-panel.png')} alt="Intellij Commit-tool window" />

You can enable this tool window by clicking `View > Tool Windows > Commit`.

<Image img={require('./assets/enable-commit-tool-window.png')} alt="Intellij Commit tool window" />

If the tool window is still not visible or looks very different, you might have to enable the
`non-modal commit interface` in the settings.

## Basic workflow

:::info

This way of working with Git strikes a balance between maximum flexibility and keeping a very easy
to understand rationale.

:::

Most commonly I work with repositories that I have direct access to, so I can push and pull.

When using your own fork you have to create a pull request to the upstream repository instead of to
the `main` branch. The rest works the same.

### 1. Create a local branch

Mostly I try to make every change or group of changes in a separate (local) branch so that I can
create a pull request when the changes are finished. create Pull Requests.

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature
```

:::note

Sometimes I make changes first, but I always switch from `main` to a feature branch before
committing the first changes

:::

### 2. Make changes

Make changes to the code, add files, remove files, etc.

:::tip

When editing code, or any file for that matter, use a proper editor like VS Code, Intellij (e.g.
WebStorm or Rider), Google IDX etc.

:::

I mostly use Intellij editors because of their superior refactoring capabilities and because of
their really neat [commit tool window](#Make-and-review-changes). All Intellij editors are free if
you contribute to open source.

### 3. Review the changes locally

Then review those changes (the `diff`) inside the IDE.

<ImageWrapper>
  <Image img={require('./assets/right-click-to-show-diff.png')} alt="Right click, show diff" />
</ImageWrapper>

<Image img={require('./assets/review-diff.png')} alt="Review diff example" />

Once reviewed and satisfied, I commit the changes, then repeat steps 2 and 3 as needed.

### 4. commit the changes

I use two ways to commit changes.

1. Simply committing **all changes** at once from the command line, using
   `git commit -am "feat: my feature description"`
2. Only committing **partial changes**. I do this using the commit tool window, simply by checking
   all files, and then unchecking some of them.

:::tip

Using the commit tool window you can even select specific lines of code to commit when you click
show diff.

  img={require('./assets/include-or-exclude-specific-lines.png')}
  alt="Include or exclude specific lines"
/>

:::

### 5. Push the changes

When the changes are ready to be shared, I push the changes to the remote repository.

```bash
git push
```

:::note

Since my git config is set up to automatically set up remote tracking branches for all new local
branches, that is all.

If that is not the case the command would be

```bash
git push -u origin my-feature
```

:::

### 6. Pull request

When the changes are pushed to the remote repository, I create a pull request to the `main` branch.

When working on a repository by myself, I usually work on getting the pull request merged
immediately.

### 7. Getting ready to work on the next feature

Update the main branch before switching back to it.

```bash
git fetch -u origin main:main
```

Then switch to it

```bash
git checkout main
```

:::info

This can be especially quick if you have just merged the feature into main, since no files need to
be changed locally - because main is already up-to-date with remote (and thus the feature that you
just merged).

### Complete flow in practice

Here's what the complete happy flow looks like in practice.

## Workflow: Remote changes, rebase using stash

Sometimes you have changes on the remote repository that you want to pull in, but you also have
local changes that you want to keep.

:::info

This is common when working on the same branch with multiple people, or when you are working from
multiple machines, or when you haven't switched into a feature branch yet.

:::

If you haven't committed your local changes yet, you can simply stash them, pull the remote changes,
and then re-apply the stashed changes.

### 1. Stash local changes

```bash
git stash
```

### 2. Pull remote changes

```bash
git pull
```

### 3. Re-apply stashed changes

```bash
git stash pop
```
