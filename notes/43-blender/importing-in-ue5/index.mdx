# Importing in UE5

## Missing faces

When importing a mesh into UE5, it is possible that some faces are missing.

The most common reason for this is that the normals of the faces are not pointing outwards. A normal
is essentially a direction vector.

The issue can easily be fixed by recalculating the face normals in Blender.
