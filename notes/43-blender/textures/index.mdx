# Textures

## UV Mapping

The UV map is a 2D representation of the 3D model. It is needed for textures to be applied to the
model.

There are 4 steps to UV mapping:

1. Apply the scale of the model (Ctrl + A > Scale)
2. Project from view (U > Project from view)
3. Mark seams (Selected edges, then Ctrl + E > Mark Seam)
4. Unwrap (U > Unwrap)
