# Blender

Here's my notes on blender. I'll keep adding to it as I learn more.

## Resources

## Conventions

### Rationale

- Always render the front towards `-Y` (create Monkey object to see the default orientation).
- A material should ideally be used to represent a material in the real world.
- Use [Linked Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENdGhAM3NzA) (simple) or
  [Collection Instances](https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/259870/105541) (advanced) to reuse objects.
  The latter allows you to edit your mesh in one place and have the changes reflected in all instances.

### Non default settings

#### Status bar

Right click the status bar to enable `Scene statistics`.

#### Interface

- Set `Color Picker Type` to `Square (SV + H)`. This will make it easier to pick more granular
  colours.

#### Navigation

- Enable `Orbit around selection`
- Enable `Auto depth`
- Enable `Zoom to mouse position`

## Vocabulary

### Interface

| Term        | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manipulator | The manipulator is the tool that allows you to move, rotate and scale objects in the 3d viewport. |

### Objects

| Term   | Description                                                                                                |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vertex | A vertex is a point in 3d space. It is the most basic element of a 3d object.                              |
| Edge   | An edge is a line between two vertices.                                                                    |
| Face   | A face is a flat surface between three or more vertices. Sometimes called Polygon.                         |
| Mesh   | A mesh is a collection of vertices, edges and faces, that create a shape.                                  |
| Object | An object is the combination of a mesh, the material and the texture. Two objects can share the same mesh. |

### Visuals

| Term     | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Material | parameters | A material is a set of properties that define what an object looks like when rendered. It contains 1 or more shaders and 0 or more textures.                |
| Shader   | logic      | A shader is a program that consists of rules and logic and runs on the GPU to determine the color of each pixel of an object based on different conditions. |
| Texture  | image      | A texture is an image that is placedon the surface of an object to give it a move realistic look.                                                           |

## Gotchas

- The camera with the solid triangle is the active camera.

## Important hotkeys

:::note

Blender shortcuts depend on the mouse cursor position.

:::

### TL;DR

Use these often for a smooth experience

- `Tab` to switch between object and edit mode
- `Shift + Space` to switch to move/rotate/scale manipulator
- `Numpad .` to focus viewport on selected object

### Mouse navigation

- `MMB` to rotate view
- `Shift + MMB` to pan view
- `Ctrl + MMB` to zoom view
- `Alt + drag MMB` to rotate view (90-degree snap) in orthographic mode

### Keyboard navigation

- `Numpad 2, 4, 6, 8` to rotate view
- `Shift + Numpad 2, 4, 6, 8` to pan view
- `Numpad +, -` to zoom view
- `Numpad 1, 3, 7` to view from front, right, top
- `Numpad 9` to rotate view 180 degrees
- `Numpad 5` to toggle orthographic/perspective view

### User interface

- Hover a field and `Ctrl + C` to copy the value. Can be a text or a number or even things like
  colours. Hover another field and `Ctrl + V` to paste the value.
- `Ctrl + PgUp` and `Ctrl + PgDn` to switch between workspaces (Layout, Modeling, Sculpting etc.)
- `Ctrl + Space` to toggle editor fullscreen mode
- `Tab` to toggle edit mode
- `1, 2, 3` to switch between vertex, edge and face selection mode
- `F9` to open last operation settings
- `N` to toggle right panel
- `Shift + S` snap menu

### Viewport

- `Home` to focus on scene
- `Numpad .` to focus on selected object
- `Alt + Z` to toggle X-ray mode
- `Z` to open shading overlay

### Camera

:::note

The camera with the solid triangle is the active camera.

:::

- `Numpad 0` to toggle Camera view
- `Ctrl + Numpad 0` to set active camera
- `Ctrl + Alt + Numpad 0` to align active camera to current view
- `G` pan camera
- `G, Z, Z` to pan camera along Z axis

### Adding an object

- `Shift + RMB` to set the 3d cursor position
- `Shift + A` to add object
- `Shift + C` to reset 3d cursor position

### Transformations

- `G` to move selected (`Alt + G` to reset)
- `R` to rotate selected (`Alt + R` to reset)
- `S` to scale selected (`Alt + S` to reset)

### Selection

- `A` to select all
- `A, A` or `Alt + A` to deselect all
- `Ctrl + I` to invert selection
- `X` to delete selected
- `H` to hide selected
- `Shift + H` to hide unselected
- `Alt + H` to reveal hidden objects
- `/` to isolate selected objects
- `L` to select linked sub-objects (vertices, edges, faces)
- `Shift + L` to deselect linked sub-objects
