# Blender

Here's my notes on blender. I'll keep adding to it as I learn more.

## Resources

- https://www.udemy.com/course/blender-3d-from-zero-to-hero

## Conventions

- Always render the front towards `-Y` (create Monkey object to see the default orientation)

## Important hotkeys

:::note

Blender shortcuts depend on the mouse cursor position.
