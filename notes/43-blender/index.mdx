# Blender

Here's my notes on blender. I'll keep adding to it as I learn more.

## Resources

- https://www.udemy.com/course/blender-3d-from-zero-to-hero

## Conventions

### Rationale

- Always render the front towards `-Y` (create Monkey object to see the default orientation)

### Non default settings

#### Status bar

Right click the status bar to enable `Scene statistics`.

#### Navigation

- Enable `Orbit around selection`
- Enable `Auto depth`
- Enable `Zoom to mouse position`

## Vocabulary

### Manipulator

The manipulator is the tool that allows you to move, rotate and scale objects in the 3d viewport.

### Vertex

A vertex is a point in 3d space. It is the most basic element of a 3d object.

### Edge

An edge is a line between two vertices.

### Face

A face is a flat surface between three or more vertices. Sometimes called Polygon.

## Important hotkeys

:::note

Blender shortcuts depend on the mouse cursor position.

### Mouse navigation

- `MMB` to rotate view
- `Shift + MMB` to pan view
- `Ctrl + MMB` to zoom view
- `Alt + drag MMB` to rotate view (90-degree snap) in orthographic mode

### Keyboard navigation

- `Numpad 2, 4, 6, 8` to rotate view
- `Shift + Numpad 2, 4, 6, 8` to pan view
- `Numpad +, -` to zoom view
- `Numpad 1, 3, 7` to view from front, right, top
- `Numpad 9` to rotate view 180 degrees
- `Numpad 5` to toggle orthographic/perspective view

### User interface

- `Ctrl + PgUp` and `Ctrl + PgDn` to switch between workspaces (Layout, Modeling, Sculpting etc.)
- `Ctrl + Space` to toggle editor fullscreen mode
- `Tab` to toggle edit mode
- `1, 2, 3` to switch between vertex, edge and face selection mode
- `F9` to open last operation settings
- `N` to toggle right panel
- `Shift + S` snap menu

### Viewport

- `Home` to focus on scene
- `Numpad .` to focus on selected object
- `Alt + Z` to toggle X-ray mode

### Adding an object

- `Shift + RMB` to set the 3d cursor position
- `Shift + A` to add object
- `Shift + C` to reset 3d cursor position

### Transformations

- `G` to move selected
- `R` to rotate selected
- `S` to scale selected

### Selection

- `A` to select all
- `A, A` or `Alt + A` to deselect all
- `Ctrl + I` to invert selection
- `X` to delete selected
- `H` to hide selected
- `Shift + H` to hide unselected
- `Alt + H` to reveal hidden objects
- `/` to isolate selected objects
- `L` to select linked sub-objects (vertices, edges, faces)
- `Shift + L` to deselect linked sub-objects
