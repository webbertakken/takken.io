# Rigging

## Bone Naming conventions

Quoting a [post](https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/49081/105541) by _Jaroslav Jerryno Novotny_ on
Blender Stack Exchange:

> Every rigger uses their own bone naming conventions, prefixes or suffixes, usually in agreement
> with animators for which the rig is intended (in studio). There is no standard, but there are
> however some commonly used terms:
>
> - ROOT, MASTER - first bone in hierarchy or sub-hierarchy (tentacle_root)
> - DEF - bone contributing to deformation
> - MCH - mechanism/mechanical helper bone
> - ORG - original bones of metarigs from which the final rig is generated
> - CTRL, CON - control bones - various bones meant to be operated by animators
> - JNT - a joint
> - WGT, SHP, CS - widget, shape, custom shape, etc. - meshes to represent bones
> - IK, FK - bones belonging to inverse or forward kinematic bone chains
> - STR, NSTR, ASTR - stretch bones, non-stretch bones, anti-stretch bones (I've also seen SCA,
>   NSCA, ASCA as scale, non-scale and anti-scale)
> - SPL - IK spline bones
> - MM, MUSC - muscle mass, muscle - bones to represent and bind muscles
> - POLE - IK pole bones, also usually just marked as CTRL
> - CW, CCW - clock-wise, counter-clock-wise, for marking rotation direction or bones for hinges
> - CEN, LFT, RGT, LF, RT, L, R - center, left, right
