# Importing in UE5

## Exporting from Blender

When exporting a mesh from Blender, it is important to use the correct settings.

## Importing into UE5

When importing a mesh into UE5, it is important to use the correct settings.

  <Image

    alt="Importing FBX in UE5: Enable Force Front X Axis"
  />
</ImageWrapper>

The result should look similar to this. The X axis (red arrow) should be pointing to the front of
the mesh.

## Missing faces

When importing a mesh into UE5, it is possible that some faces are missing.

The most common reason for this is that the normals of the faces are not pointing outwards. A normal
is essentially a direction vector.

The issue can easily be fixed by recalculating the face normals in Blender.
