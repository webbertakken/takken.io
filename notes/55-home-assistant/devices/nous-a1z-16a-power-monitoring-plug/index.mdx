## Installation

#### Introduction

This smart plug is Zigbee based, meaning all communication goes over the Zigbee technology and
protocol.

It needs to be connected to a Zigbee orchestrator. Any communication received by that orchestrator
can be read by the Zigbee2MQTT service. Zigbee2MQTT exposes information to HomeAssistant using MQTT
discovery. Finally, the device needs to be calibrated so that the energy readings are correct.

#### Prerequisites

- A working Zigbee dongle or hub
- Zigbee2MQTT service running

##### Pairing

1. In the Zigbee2MQTT service set the following setting in the root of `configuration.yaml`

```yaml
permit_join: true
```

2. Plug in the socket (light will be blinking)
3. Wait for a few seconds for the pairing to complete.
4. Open `configuration.yaml` of the `Zigbee2MQTT` service and change the friendly name of the newly
   detected device like so:

```diff
devices:
  '0xa4c138053f778359':
-    friendly_name: '0xa4c138053f778359'
+    friendly_name: 'The Fan'
```

:::tip

Use a name that might be useful in phrases like "Hey Google, turn on <friendly_name>"

:::

5. Restart the `Zigbee2MQTT` service.

:::note

In Zigbee2MQTT, the following setting allows HomeAssistant to discover the paired devices.

```yaml
homeassistant: true
```

:::

6. Inside HomeAssistant you should be able to see devices under the `MQTT` plugin

  <Image img={require('./assets/mqtt-devices.png')} />
  <Image img={require('./assets/controls.png')} />
</ImageWrapper>

7. Use the controls to test if the socket goes on and off without any problems.

:::note

In my case not all devices functioned as expected

#### Calibration

Calibration of the energy meter can be done MQTT

I've found this guide: https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/A1Z.html

Use an MQTT client (like MQTT Explorer) to send below commands.

Commands will consist of a `topic` and a `payload`. The `topic` is the first part of the command and
the `payload` is the second (JSON) part of the command.

##### Check connection

First things first, lets check that we are connected and calibrating the correct socket by switching
it on and off.

```bash
zigbee2mqtt/the_fan/set {"state": "TOGGLE"}
```

##### Get status
