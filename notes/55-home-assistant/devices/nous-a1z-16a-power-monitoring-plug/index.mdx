## Installation

### Pairing

This smart LED spotlight is Zigbee based, meaning all communication goes over the Zigbee technology
and protocol. It needs to be [paired](../../pairing/zigbee) with a Zigbee coordinator.

Finally, this device also needs to be calibrated so that the energy readings are correct.

### Configuration

Use the controls to test if the socket goes on and off without any problems.

### Calibration

Calibration of the energy meter can be done MQTT

I've found this guide: https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/A1Z.html

Use an MQTT client (like MQTT Explorer) to send below commands.

Commands will consist of a `topic` and a `payload`. The `topic` is the first part of the command and
the `payload` is the second (JSON) part of the command.

#### Check connection

First things first, lets check that we are connected and calibrating the correct socket by switching
it on and off.

```bash
zigbee2mqtt/the_fan/set {"state": "TOGGLE"}
```
