## Installation

#### Introduction

There will be a hardware and a software part to this installation.

Before physically installing the motor it needs to be paired with the network and with a remote.

Then the motor is installed inside the roller blinds tube.

#### Pairing with the network

- Put the Zigbee network in pairing mode (see [pairing](../../pairing/zigbee))
- Press the button on the motor 3 times
- The motor will shake

The device exposes the following features:

#### Remotes

You need to buy one motor with a remote, because the remote is used to set the direction, min and
max of the rolling blinds.

There are 3 remotes that I know of. From left to right the `ZC175A-9`, `Z123a-1` and `ZC171A-1`.

I've configured my setup using the `ZC171A-1` remote. The `Set` button in the back is important.

#### Installing the motor

The tube is 38mm in diameter.

## Pairing

#### Pairing the remote

- Long-press the motor button, until the motor shakes
- Press the remote `Up` or `Down` button immediately after

#### Unpairing the remote

- Long-press the motor button, until 5 seconds after the motor shakes

## Configuration

- Press and hold the `Up` button on the remote until the motor shakes

#### Setting the upper limit

- Remote `Set` 1 time, immediately followed by the `Up` button
