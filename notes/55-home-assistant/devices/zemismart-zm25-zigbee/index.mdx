## Installation

#### Introduction

There will be a hardware and a software part to this installation.

Before physically installing the motor it needs to be paired with the network and with a remote.

Then the motor is installed inside the roller blinds tube.

#### Pairing with the network

- Put the Zigbee network in pairing mode
- Press the button on the motor 3 times
- The motor will shake

#### Pairing with remote

You need to have one version with a remote, because the remote is used to set the min and the max of
the rolling blinds.

#### Installing the motor

The tube is 38mm in diameter.
