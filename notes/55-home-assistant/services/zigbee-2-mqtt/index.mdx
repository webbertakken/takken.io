# Zigbee2MQTT

## Gotchas

### Safety against errors

Even though Zigbee2MQTT might run fine for months, it could suddenly start crashing periodically.

One example is the Zigbee USB device
[suddenly stop working](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/17809) after having worked
flawlessly for a while.

:::note

When Zigbee2MQTT docker crashes, it will not restart automatically.

:::

To solve this, I've added `--restart unless-stopped` to Extra Parameters in the docker (advanced)
edit view
