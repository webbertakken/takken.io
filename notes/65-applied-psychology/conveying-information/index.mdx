# Conveying information

After having written quite a few formal and informal documents and regularly explaining various
topics, I've picked up on a few useful practices and things to be aware of.

## Communication window

There's a certain amount of words or time you have to grip your audience's attention. The attention
span might differ depending on the medium.

Depending on the user's familiarity with the topic, concepts might be understood to varying degrees.
And ignorance (a lack of knowledge or information) is different from stupidity (a lack of good sense
or judgement).

The combination between your audience's attention span and their understanding is what I call the
communication window. Effectively any surplus words spent on the topic might end up being wasted.

## Technical writing

Through hundreds of instances of feedback, or also often the lack thereof, and from analysing page
analytics of web applications I've learned that it's important to write both concisely and in a way
that's broadly easy to understand.

Apart from tailoring to the audience, the medium and the goal, to write concise text well you need
to consider context, relevance, weight and importance.

- **Context** so that the information can be correctly interpreted.
- **Relevance** to ensure information is useful.
- **Importance**, as some words might not need to be written at all.

A great way to make information easy to understand is to provide a clear structure that is easy to
follow. Use headings, lists, tables, diagrams, etc. to make the information easy to digest.
