# Networking

## Rationale

Adding networking to a project quickly adds a lot of complexity and is non-trivial. Tutorials make
it seem easy, but don't usually cover many edge cases and real world implementation problems.

:::info

It is generally not recommended to add multiplayer to your first project. Most developers, including
myself, ignore this.

:::

So what is there to know?

1. It is complex and takes much time.
2. When integrating multiplayer it is crucial to understand the underlying concepts that make for
   non-buggy multiplayer experiences. Without understanding these concepts, your networked game
   might open the door to cheaters or fall apart when introducing some latency.

## Framework

Firstly, here are
[some old docs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/Networking/Blueprints/)
with a decent explanation of the different blueprints and their replication rationale.

You can have replication using Blueprints only (perhaps not recommended for complex games yet).

[Unreal Engine Framework Reference](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/gameplay-framework-quick-reference-in-unreal-engine/),

## Authority

[A quick read](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html).

It's important to understand what kind of experience you're trying to create. The incentive to cheat
in a friendly 4 player co-op game might be negligible. A competitive race game is a very different
story.

For the co-op game you might choose to have clients make decisions that reflect the game state. This
is called **client-authoritative**. For the competitive race game, you will need a server that
confirms the data for every frame each client sends. This is called **server-authoritative**.

If the nature of your game allows you to implement features in a client-authoritative way, it might
be legitimately valuable to choose that to keep complexity down and development speed up. For
example, you might consider having clients make decisions about their characters and the game state
and exchange data (perhaps directly) with other clients.

## Replication

[Client-side prediction](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-side-prediction-server-reconciliation.html) -
and for server authoritative games, server reconciliation - are essential for networked games.

**Client-side prediction** is when you don't wait for the server to accept your movement data based
on previous frames, but rather already take the unconfirmed actions (i.e. movement) to conceal
negative effects of network latency. This is essential in any networked game.

**Server reconciliation** is the process where a client's game state is updated to match the
server's authoritative version to ensure consistency in multiplayer games. A client should be ready
to roll back a number of framed to the last confirmed frame if necessary.

The
[Character Movement Component (CMC)](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/understanding-networked-movement-in-the-character-movement-component-for-unreal-engine/)
and Vehicle Movement Component (VMC) from
[Chaos Vehicles-plugin](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/vehicles-in-unreal-engine/) have
built-in support for client-side prediction and server reconciliation. They take away **much** of
the complexity for you. However, adding custom animations quickly complicate things; you will need
to extend the blueprint and might quickly also need C++ code.

### Testing

Testing replication at its basis is very simple.

#### Use multiple clients

- Start the game using multiple clients

<Image img={require('./assets/testing-replication.png')} alt="Testing replication" />

#### Simulating network latency

Simulating latency and package loss can be done in the Editor Preferences.

These settings will most likely start showing some lag-induced stutter in the movement of actors.

This is what client-side prediction is for. Currently, UE5 example projects don't have client-side
prediction implemented, so you will need to implement it yourself.
