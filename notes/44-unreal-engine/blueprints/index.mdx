# Blueprints

Blueprints are graphical representations of anything you would otherwise have to code.

In blueprint projects, blueprints can completely replace code. They are quite intuitive and easy to
use, and you can make them as complex as you want.

:::info Higher level languages

In terms of programming languages, I would argue that the higher level the language, the faster you
can develop, as you're less bogged down by details. This often goes at the expense of flexibility
and performance. However, as long as performance is still adequate for making great user experiences
and you have enough flexibility to be effective, it's often a great trade-off.

## Variables

Variables are the most basic building blocks of blueprints. They are used to store and manipulate
data.

### Types

These are the basic variable types:

<Image img={require('./assets/variable-types.png')} alt="Variable types" />

### Splitting and recombining

You can split and recombine pins.

<ImageWrapper>
  <Image img={require('./assets/splitting-a-pin.png')} alt="Splitting a pin" />
  <Image img={require('./assets/result-of-splitting-a-pin.png')} alt="Result of splitting a pin" />
  <Image img={require('./assets/recombining-a-pin.png')} alt="Recombining a pin" />
</ImageWrapper>

### Making and breaking

An simple but important concept is making and breaking.

<Image img={require('./assets/making-and-breaking.png')} alt="Making and breaking" />

### Custom types

You can create custom types.

- A `struct` (Structure) combines multiple variables into a single variable.
- An `enum` (Enumeration) is a variable that can only have a few specific values.

You can create both from the context menu in the Content Drawer.

<Image img={require('./assets/creating-a-struct-or-enum.png')} alt="Creating a struct" />

You can then define the shape of the struct or enum.

<ImageWrapper>
  <Image img={require('./assets/defining-a-struct.png')} alt="Defining a struct" />
  <Image img={require('./assets/defining-an-enum.png')} alt="Defining an enum" />
</ImageWrapper>

You can then use the custom type as a variable. You can also use them in collections, like arrays.

<ImageWrapper>
  <Image
    img={require('./assets/using-custom-variable-types.png')}
    alt="Using custom variable types"
  />
  <Image
    img={require('./assets/turn-variable-into-collection-of-type.png')}
    alt="Turn variable into collection of type"
  />
</ImageWrapper>

### Collections

Collections are variables that store multiple values of the same type.

#### Arrays

Arrays are the most common type of collection. They are used to store a list of values. You can add
and remove items from an array. Utility functions are used to manipulate arrays.

<ImageWrapper>
  <Image
    img={require('./assets/array-adding-and-removing.png')}
    alt="Array - adding and removing"
  />
  <Image img={require('./assets/array-utilities.png')} alt="Array - utility functions" />
</ImageWrapper>

Example: moving an item from one array to another.

<Image img={require('./assets/move-item-between-arrays.png')} alt="Move item between arrays" />

## Events

Events are used to trigger actions in response to something happening.
