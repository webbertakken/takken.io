# Unreal Engine

Here's my notes on Unreal Engine 5. I'll keep adding to it as I learn more.

See addendum for more resources.

## Conventions

### Rationale

- Always use Lumen (and disable static lighting)
- Always use Nanite (and set Nanite to Enabled for the mesh of each object asset)
  - Nanite does not work for non-opaque materials and two-sided meshes
- Get assets from Quixel Bridge
- Use Blueprints for everything that you reuse

### Non default settings

#### Interface

- Open project settings and pin it to the left side of the screen.

## Vocabulary

### Assets

| Prefix | Term              | Description                     |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `BP_`  | Blueprint         | Encapsulates objects and logic  |
| `M_`   | Main Material     | Template for Material instances |
| `MI_`  | Material Instance | Instance of a Main Material     |
| `SM_`  | Static Mesh       | Mesh that does not move         |
| `S_`   | Skeletal Mesh     | Mesh that moves                 |
| `T_`   | Texture           | Image used for materials        |

### Materials

| Term       | Description                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Base Color | Color of the material                       |
| Metallic   | How metallic the material is                |
| Roughness  | How rough the material is (smooth vs rough) |
| Normal     | How much the material is affected by light  |

## Concepts

### Blueprints

- Use variables to store values. The setting `Instance Editable` makes it possible to change the value in the editor.
- Use functions to encapsulate and reuse logic.
- Use custom events to organize logic.
- Use event dispatchers to send events to other blueprints.

## Gotchas

- When lighting shows low quality baking, try to increase the lightmap resolution of the mesh.

## Important hotkeys

### General

- `Ctrl` + `Space` to open Content Drawer
- `Ctrl` + `B` to find related assets
- `End` to drop the selected asset on the surface
- `Shift` + `F1` to get the mouse cursor back

### Mouse navigation

- `LMB` to move
- `RMB` to pan view
- `MMB` to drag view

### Keyboard navigation

- `F` to focus on selected object

### Graph

- `1` + `RMB` to create a scalar node.
- `2` + `RMB` to create a vector2 node.
- `3` + `RMB` to create a vector3 node.
- `M` + `RMB` to create a multiply node.
- `L` + `RMB` to create a lerp node.
- Drag + `R` to create a reroute node.

### Important console commands

- `stat fps` to show fps
- `stat unit` to show frame time
- `stat rhi` to show gpu mem and triangles count
