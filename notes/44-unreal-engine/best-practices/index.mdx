# Best practices

On this page I'll list some best practice basics. It's intended to be a list of "wish I'd known that
sooner" items.

I assume that you are familiar with everything from the [blueprints](../blueprints) section.

## Blueprint Interfaces

:::info Heuristic

Use interfaces where you can, but only when the number of use cases exceeds one.

**Example 1:** if multiple actors can be picked up, have them implement `IPickupable`.  
**Example 2:** if receiving currency is unique to `Players`, you should not use interface for it.

:::

Prevent casting and make your blueprints more modular by using Blueprint Interfaces.

## Enums, Structs and Datatables

:::info Heuristic

Everything you don't want to hardcode goes into an Enum or a DataTable.

:::

- `Enums` are a way to create a list of predefined values that you can use in your blueprints.
- `Structs` allow you to make structured collections of data that fit your needs.
- `DataTables` are lightweight databases where you can store information based on a struct.

## Blueprint Function Libraries

:::info Heuristic

Find yourself copy-pasting logic between blueprints?  
It's time to create a Blueprint Function Library.

:::

Blueprint Function Libraries are a way to create reusable functions that can be called from any
blueprint.
