# Introduction

:::info

GoPro is an American company known for its durable and versatile action cameras designed to capture
high-definition video in extreme conditions. ðŸ“·

:::

In 2023, I purchased a GoPro Hero 12 Black, that I use for diving, hiking, skiing and other outdoor
activities. Below I'm keeping track of things I've learned about the camera and any configuration
options.

## GoPro Labs

:::info

GoPro Labs is a platform for sharing experimental features for GoPro cameras. It is a way for GoPro
to get feedback on features that are still in development and to test new features that may or may
not be included in future camera updates.

:::

Special firmware has to be installed to unlock the latest beta features.

### Getting started

- Download a GoPro Labs image: https://gopro.github.io/labs/
- Follow the update procedure: https://gopro.github.io/labs/install/
- Download the (unofficial) QR Control app on your phone to generate QR codes
  ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miscdata.qrcontrol&hl=en_US),
  [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/qrcontrol/id1518134202)).
- Scan any QR codes with your Labs-enabled GoPro to enable the features.

### Histogram

To see the exposure levels of your GoPro, you can enable the histogram feature.
