# A girl and her friend in the ocean of blue, part 2

<PoemText>

In the realm where the cold waters flow,
A maiden fair with a mind aglow,
Ventured forth 'neath the sky so grand,
Camera in heart, and lens in hand.

She sought the giants of the deep,
Where orcas leap and humpbacks sweep,
With drones and lenses, sharp and keen,
To capture sights so rarely seen.

Upon a zodiac, swift and light,
She sailed through day, and into night,
The captain, kind, of family dreams,
Guided her through the ocean streams.

Beside her, a passenger, kind and keen,
Witness to wonders seldom seen,
Together they watched the dance of the sea,
In awe of its wild, untamed beauty.

Yet despite her skill and ardent tries,
Her photos failed to match her eyes,
The orcas’ grace, the whales’ grand song,
Elusive in imagery, though her heart strong.

Each day she battled wave and wind,
Hoping her art would soon begin,
To mirror the majesty she found,
In the ocean's depths, profound.

But though her captures might not suffice,
The journey itself was worth the price,
For in each moment, each splash, each dive,
Her spirit, her joy, intensely alive.

A week of trials, of seas unkind,
Yet in her heart, no regret to find,
For every encounter, brief and sweet,
Left memories no failure could defeat.

So sails the girl with camera and dream,
In a world more beautiful than it may seem,
And though her quest has yet to end,
She cherishes each moment, each sea-bound friend.

With every click, with every frame,
Her adventure continues, never the same,
In the dance of the waves, the ocean's song,
Where she, and the wild, truly belong.
