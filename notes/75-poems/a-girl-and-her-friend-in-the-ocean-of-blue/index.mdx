# A girl and her friend in the ocean of blue

<PoemText>

In the depths of blue, 'neath the sun's bright gaze,
A maiden fair, with a camera's blaze,
Roamed the sea's vast, mysterious halls,
Captured in her lens, the ocean's calls.

With hair like night and mind sharp as day,
She sought the truths that in deep waters lay.
Her heart, a drum, for the ocean's art,
Her soul, a canvas, for creatures apart.

In realms where light dared scarce to tread,
Amongst the coral, colored vivid and red,
She found her muse, in the ocean's heart,
A shark, fierce and wild, a living work of art.

"O mighty creature, with eyes like the moon,
Why do you swim in this watery lagoon?"
The shark circled close, its fins like a song,
In this liquid world, where both did belong.

The girl, undaunted, gazed into its eyes,
Seeing a wisdom, ancient and wise.
"O friend of the deep, let's make a pact,
To explore together, with courage intact."

The shark, as if smiling, agreed to her plea,
Together they roamed, both wild and free.
Through caverns and reefs, they danced in the light,
The girl and the shark, in the ocean's night.

In every photo, she captured its grace,
The beauty and power in its watery space.
In return, it showed her its hidden domain,
A world beneath waves, where wonder did reign.

And so they ventured, 'neath sun and star,
A girl and her friend, from near and far.
In the depths of the sea, where mysteries soar,
Their story, unfinished, forevermore.
