# Being in the moment

<!-- truncate -->

Being present in the moment, also referred to as mindfulness, is the practice of fully engaging with
the present rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. It means experiencing
life as it happens, with full awareness and without judgement.

When you're truly present, you notice details you might otherwise miss, experience deeper joy in
simple pleasures, and respond to situations with clarity rather than react from habit. This practice
reduces anxiety, enhances creativity, and allows you to form genuine connections with others who
feel truly seen and heard.
