# Growth Mindset

<!-- truncate -->

A growth mindset is the belief that basic qualities, like talent and intelligence are not fixed.
That they can be developed through hard work, persistence and learning from failure. In contrast, a
fixed mindset assumes you’re born with set levels of those qualities and they cannot change.

The term "growth mindset" comes from Carol Dweck, who reviewed a decade of research and showed that
what we believe directly influences our learning and achievements. This doesn’t deny the
heritability of traits or the role of upbringing, but shows those qualities aren’t static.
