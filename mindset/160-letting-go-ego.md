# Letting go of the ego

<!-- truncate -->

Letting go of the ego means releasing the need to be right, to be superior, or to constantly defend
your self-image. It's about recognising that your worth doesn't depend on external validation or
comparison with others.

When you loosen the ego's grip, you become more open to learning, more compassionate towards others,
and more at peace with yourself. This practice allows you to connect authentically, admit mistakes
without shame, and grow from experiences that your ego might otherwise reject as threatening to your
self-concept.
