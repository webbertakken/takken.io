# Growth mindset

<!-- truncate -->

A growth mindset is the belief that basic qualities, like talent and intelligence are not fixed.
That they can be developed through hard work, persistence and learning from failure. In contrast, a
fixed mindset assumes youâ€™re born with set levels of those qualities and they cannot change.

The term "growth mindset" comes from [Carol Dweck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck), who
reviewed a decade of research and showed that what you believe directly influences your learning and
achievements. This doesn't deny the heritability of traits or the role of upbringing, but shows
those qualities aren't static.
