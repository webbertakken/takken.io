# Maslow's hierarchy of basic needs

<!-- truncate -->

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory that comprises a five-tier model of human
needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid. From bottom to top, the needs are:
physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualisation.

The theory suggests that people are motivated to fulfil basic needs before moving on to more
advanced needs. Only when lower-level needs are satisfied can individuals attend to needs higher up.
This framework helps you understand what drives human behaviour and how you can structure your life
for fulfilment.
