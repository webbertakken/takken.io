# Taking the time to be intentional

<!-- truncate -->

Being intentional means making conscious choices about how you spend your time, energy, and
attention rather than drifting through life on autopilot. It's about pausing to consider your
actions and their alignment with your values and goals.

This practice requires slowing down in a fast-paced world, creating space for reflection, and making
deliberate decisions. When you're intentional, you design your days rather than react to them,
invest in what truly matters, and create meaningful progress towards your vision. Small intentional
acts compound over time to create profound life changes.
