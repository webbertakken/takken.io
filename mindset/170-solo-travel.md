# Solo travel

<!-- truncate -->

Solo travel is a powerful tool for self-discovery and personal growth. When you journey alone,
you're fully responsible for your choices, forced to rely on your own resources, and free to follow
your curiosity without compromise.

Travelling solo strips away familiar support systems and social roles, revealing who you are at your
core. It builds confidence, enhances problem-solving skills, and opens you to unexpected connections
with strangers. These experiences teach you that you're more capable than you imagined and that the
world is generally kinder than you feared, fostering both independence and trust.
