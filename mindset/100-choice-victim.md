# Choice to be a victim or not

<!-- truncate -->

Every day you face a fundamental choice: to see yourself as a victim of circumstances or as an
empowered individual who can influence your own life. This choice shapes not only how you experience
events but also what possibilities open up to you.

Choosing not to be a victim doesn't mean denying pain or injustice. It means recognising that while
you can't control what happens to you, you can control your response to it. By taking responsibility
for your reactions and focusing on what you can change, you reclaim your power and become an active
creator of your life story rather than a passive sufferer.
