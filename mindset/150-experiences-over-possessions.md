# Favour experiences over possessions

<!-- truncate -->

Research consistently shows that experiences bring more lasting happiness than material possessions.
While the joy from a new purchase fades quickly, memories of meaningful experiences grow richer over
time and become part of who you are.

Choosing experiences over possessions means investing in travel, learning, relationships, and
adventures rather than accumulating things. These experiences expand your perspectives, create
shared bonds with others, and provide stories that enrich your life. By prioritising experiences,
you build a life measured not by what you own but by what you've lived.
