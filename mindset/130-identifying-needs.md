# Identifying needs and acting on them

<!-- truncate -->

Understanding your true needs—physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual—is essential for
creating a fulfilling life. Too often you ignore these needs or confuse them with wants, leading to
dissatisfaction despite apparent success.

The practice involves developing self-awareness to recognise what you genuinely need, distinguishing
needs from desires, and taking concrete action to meet those needs. This might mean setting
boundaries, seeking support, changing environments, or developing new skills. By honouring your
authentic needs, you build a life aligned with your deepest values and natural rhythms.
