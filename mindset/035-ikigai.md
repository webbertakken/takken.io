# Ikigai

<!-- truncate -->

Ikigai is a Japanese concept meaning "reason for being" or "purpose in life." It's found at the
intersection of four elements: what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what
you can be paid for. When these align, you discover your ikigai.

Finding your ikigai isn't about achieving grand success but discovering what makes you want to get
up each morning. It might be as simple as tending a garden or as complex as solving global
challenges. This concept teaches you that purpose comes from contributing to something beyond
yourself while using your unique gifts and passions.
